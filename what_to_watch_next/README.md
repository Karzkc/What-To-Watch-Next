# 🎬 What To Watch Next

> A movie & TV show discovery app that actually helps you find something good to watch (finally!)

Hey there! 👋 I'm **Kartik**, just a college student who loves programming way too much. Built this little project because, let's be honest, spending 30 minutes scrolling through Netflix trying to find something to watch is NOT it.

## 🤔 What's This About?

Tired of the endless "what should we watch tonight?" debates? Yeah, me too. So I made this thing that helps you discover movies and TV shows based on what you're actually in the mood for. No more decision paralysis!

## ✨ What It Does

- **Smart Search**: Find movies and shows without having to remember exact titles
- **Genre Filtering**: In the mood for horror? Comedy? We got you covered
- **Trending Content**: See what everyone's talking about right now
- **Detailed Info**: Ratings, release dates,genres - all the good stuff
- **Responsive Design**: Works on your phone, laptop, whatever you got

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Next.js** - Because it's awesome
- **React** - The usual suspect
- **TypeScript** - Keeps me from breaking things (mostly)
- **Tailwind CSS** - For making things look decent
- **TMDB API** - The real MVP providing all the movie data
- **Framer Motion** - For those smooth animations that make me feel like a real developer

## 🚀 Want to Run It Locally?

```bash
# Clone this bad boy
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd what-to-watch-next

# Install dependencies (grab some coffee, this might take a sec)
npm install

# Get your TMDB API key from https://www.themoviedb.org/
# Create a .env.local file and add:
NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Fire it up!
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be good to go!

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Look, I'll be real with you - I'm not a designer. I'm more of a "make it work first, make it pretty later" kind of person. But hey, I tried my best to make it look decent! 

The UI is pretty straightforward:
- Clean and minimal (fancy word for "I kept it simple")
- Subtle theme 
- Smooth animations because they make everything feel premium
- Mobile-first because who uses desktops anymore? (jk, it works on everything)

## 🐛 Known Issues (aka "Features")

Since I'm just learning and this is a side project, there might be some quirks:

- Sometimes the API takes a hot minute to load (blame TMDB, not me 😅)
- Design might look weird on some screen sizes (I tested on like 3 devices, sue me)
- Might have some TypeScript errors I haven't caught yet
- The search might not find really obscure movies (working on it!)

**Found a bug or have suggestions?** Please let me know! I'm always down to learn and improve. You can:
- Open an issue on GitHub
- Hit me up on my socials
- Send smoke signals (jk, please don't)

## 🎓 What I Learned

This project taught me a ton:
- Working with external APIs (TMDB is pretty cool)
- Next.js routing and dynamic pages
- Making things responsive (harder than it looks!)
- TypeScript debugging (my new nemesis and best friend)
- The art of making loading states not suck

## 💭 Future Plans

If I find time between assignments and Netflix binges:
- [ ] User accounts and watchlists
- [ ] Better recommendation algorithm
- [ ] More filtering options
- [ ] Maybe a "random movie" button for the indecisive folks
- [ ] Dark/light mode toggle (currently stuck in dark mode, sorry light mode lovers)

## 🙏 Credits & Thanks

- **TMDB** for the awesome free API
- **My coffee mug** for being there through those late coding sessions

- **You** for actually reading this README (seriously, thanks!)

## 📝 License

MIT License - basically do whatever you want with it, just don't blame me if something breaks 😄

*Made with ☕ and probably too much caffeine by a college student who should be studying instead of coding*

**P.S.** - If you actually use this and find it helpful, that would honestly make my day. And if you find any bugs or have ideas to make it better, I'm all ears! Learning never stops, right?
